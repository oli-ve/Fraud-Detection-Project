<h2>Important Information about Grid Search</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Juypter Notebook contains a cell performing grid search. This was very resource intensive and took >1hr to run.</li>
  <li>The hyperparameters have since been altered, so it shouldn't take too long now, but still exercise caution.</li>
</ul>
